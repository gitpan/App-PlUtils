=head1 NAME

plcost - Run Perl script with Devel::EndStats

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.04 of plcost (from Perl distribution App-PlUtils), released on 2014-12-03.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % plcost parse-id-phone

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<pmcost> (from L<App::PMUtils> distribution)

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C plcost plcost

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

You can also install L<App::BashCompletionProg> which makes it easy to add completion for Perinci::CmdLine-based scripts. After you install the module and put C<. ~/.bash-complete-prog> (or C<. /etc/bash-complete-prog>), you can just run C<bash-completion-prog> and the C<complete> command will be added to your C<~/.bash-completion-prog>. Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command.

=head2 fish

To activate fish completion for this script, execute:

 begin; set -lx COMP_SHELL fish; set -lx COMP_MODE gen_command; plcost; end > $HOME/.config/fish/completions/plcost.fish

Or if you want to install globally, you can instead write the generated script to C</etc/fish/completions/plcost.fish> or C</usr/share/fish/completions/plcost.fish>. The exact path might be different on your system. Please check your C<fish_complete_path> variable.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete plcost 'p/*/`plcost`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

=head2 zsh

To activate zsh completion for this script, put:

 _plcost() { read -l; local cl="$REPLY"; read -ln; local cp="$REPLY"; reply=(`COMP_SHELL=zsh COMP_LINE="$cl" COMP_POINT="$cp" plcost`) }

 compctl -K _plcost plcost

in your zsh startup (e.g. C<~/.zshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.
